## Overview
Nyenyeri Book Hub is a web application designed to help users discover and browse books. The app allows users to search, filter, and sort books based on criteria such as author or  published year. It uses **React** with **TypeScript** for the front end and a **Node.js** backend API to manage book data. 

This project demonstrates the integration of front and backend technologies to build a full-stack application. It also includes plans for user authentication and authorization in the future.

## Project Goals

- **Frontend:**
 - User-friendly interface for browsing books.
- Filtering and searching books by various criteria (Title, author, published year, etc.).
  - A responsive layout for different screen sizes.
  - Future support for user accounts and book ratings.

- **Backend:**
  - A RESTful API for managing book data.
  - Data storage and retrieval (using MongoDB).

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend (React with TypeScript)

- **TypeScript:** Provides type safety and improves maintainability.
- **State Management:** Context API or Redux for managing the state ( user interactions, filters).
- **UI Library:** Material-UI to enhance the user interface.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes for a seamless experience.

### Backend (Node.js)
